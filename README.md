# 2FA-Project Server Side APIs

- 2FA-Project is a fun project I developed during my undergraduation days.
- It's work on B2B model
- Our Clients are the developers that are looking for a good 2FA(2 Factor Authentication) service or looking for a OTP service to verify email ownership of its users
- Project is providing a solution by verifying the website domain name of client and then sending a OTP verification mail to their users on behalf of them
- We provide OTP verification panel for the users, after OTP verification user is redirected to the subroute of client's domain.

# NOTE
- This repo contains all the APIs used by frontend server of 2FA-Project.
- Nobody exept the frontend server is allowed use this APIs
- The documentation here is only for refernce of my work done for this project and how I implemented logic to design APIs
